Currently studying Bioinformatics 🧬👨‍💻 at the University of Amsterdam.
Worked in Neuroscience research 🧠 for 3 and half years. I have always enjoyed coding 👨‍💻, technical challanges and problem solving, during assignments at University, at my work place and in my free time. 
I am mainly interested in Biomedical 💊🩺 Data Science and Structural Bioinformatics, since these combine my two passions: Computer Science and Biology, just like this amazing implementation of the game of life, by Edward Thomson:
